					<h3>Curruira 33</h3>
					<p>The Curruira 33 is a displacement trawler designed to be a long range coastal cruising yacht. The round hull lines plan is based on a 28 foot motor yacht we designed a few years ago, the Southern Voyager 28. This trawler is doing a successful career among our stock plans with dozens of units being built or already finished in different countries, a few of them being chosen as permanent dwelling by some our clients.</p>

					<h3>Kiribati 36</h3>
					<p>This design was born from a free-minded interpretation of another design from our office, the MC 36 SK, and the solutions applied were the result of a 10 year,  25000 nautical miles voyage on board a yacht of the same size through some of the most remote and beautiful areas of our planet.</p>
